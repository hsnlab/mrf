\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented both theoretical and empirical claims that locality-boosting load balancing combined with parallel self-adjusting algorithms yield faster-than-linear speedup in many disparate applications on a wide range of workloads. Our main contribution not necessarily stands in that we show that superlinear speedup is \emph{possible} (this has been know for quite some time), but rather that we identify the main architectural components commonly appearing in all cases where it was genuinely observed and synthesizing these into a comprehensive and universal design methodology to \emph{reproduce} it.
